## About me 

Hi my name is Eric, a third year Mathematics-Computer Science major and Computing music minor. My interest for CS originally came from my love for video games and growing up with them. I always enjoyed the experience and the immersive worlds they provided. My initial goal in high school was to become a game developer but now I'm interested in frontend web development after taking CSE 134B. Even though my goals have changed a bit, my passion for games is still strong. I'm currently involved in **Triton Gaming**, where we plan and host events for people who are interested in games to meet eachother and overall have fun!
